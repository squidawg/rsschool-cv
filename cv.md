## About me
I am Python learner (started 1 year ago) who is willing to dive into Java Script development .
I have finished CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course, my diploma project was a Flask based application (Booking system for a restaurant). While developing pet project I did research about J/s. And I really liked this language. For now my goal is to finish Rs school J/s course and to learn a lot from it.
currently based in Tbilisi
